6.0. ROC diagram for comparing methods for checking A
7.3. not working because when you do specific threshold you might get good mse or bad.
7.4. we just need to many samples (=1M) so we will have statistics with rare cases and it's too heavy...
7.5. you cannot use theoretical values, because mse is mainly from rare cases that you random, so you need to run full system with random, not with theoretical values
